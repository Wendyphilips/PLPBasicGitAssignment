DOCUMENTATION ON GIT AND GITHUB WORKFLOW:
Here's a step-by-step guide to creating a text file in your GitHub repository using developer’s tools such as Git Bash and Visual Studio Code (VS Code):
Prerequisites:
- Git is installed on my system.
- VS Code is installed on my system.
- I have a GitHub account.

Steps:

1. Create a repository
I navigated to my profile on my GitHub account, clicked on “your repositories” and created a new repository called “PLPBasicGitAssignment”

Clone the Repository:
-Copy the HTTPS code of your repo  
 - Open Git Bash.
- I navigated to the directory where I wanted to clone my repository:
     
     cd c:/
   
   - Clone  GitHub repository:
   Next step, I typed in the command,
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

   - Navigated into my repository directory:
     cd ‘PLPBasicGitAssignment.git’

Next Command was,
Code .

 (Which led me to my Vscode)

2. I opened the Repository in VS Code:
   - Open VS Code.
   - Open the cloned repository folder in VS Code by selecting `File > Open Folder` and navigating to the repository directory.

3. Create a New Text File:
   - In VS Code, click on the `New File` icon or right-click in the file explorer and select `New File`.
   - I named the file `hello.txt` 

4. Editing the Text File:
   - I opened the newly created text file and add some content to it.
“Hello, Git!”
   - Then I went ahead to save the file.


5. Stage the Changes:
   Open a new terminal using Git bash and stage the new file
     git add hello.txt

6. Commit the Change:
   - I went ahead to commit the changes with a descriptive message:
     git commit -m "Add hello.txt with a greet”

7. Push the Changes to GitHub:
   - I pushed the changes to the remote repository:
     git push -u origin main

To verify if the change reflects on my GitHub account, I had to go back to my account:
- Go to your GitHub repository in a web browser.
- Navigate to the branch you pushed to
- You should see the new `hello.txt` file with your content.
